## 📁 Files Overview

### 1. `extract_training_data.py`
- Reads `eve.json` generated by Suricata.
- Extracts key features from alerts and generates a labeled dataset (`labeled_alerts.csv`).
- Temporary labeling is based on `alert.severity`.

### 2. `train_ai_ids.py`
- Trains a **Random Forest classifier** using `labeled_alerts.csv`.
- Saves the trained model as `ai_ids_model.joblib` for later use.

### 3. `ai_suricata_to_json.py`
- Loads the trained model.
- Reads Suricata alerts from `eve.json`.
- Classifies each alert using the AI model.
- Stores classified alerts with `ai_confidence` into `ai_alerts.json` for the web dashboard.
